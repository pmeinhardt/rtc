# npipe

Ideas:

- [ ] Raw version with session info (encoded as text) exchanged over separate channel (SMS, Signal, Slack, email, â€¦)
- [ ] Adapter for exchanging session info based on GitHub user names (encrypt SDP via SSH public key + signing)
- [ ] Other SDP exchange channels via add-on tools
- [ ] Web-client interface (static HTML + JS) for non-technical users (send and or receive)
- [ ] Find a better name?
- [ ] Demo apps?
- [ ] Chat
- [ ] Game

```shell
echo "HELO" | npipe
